# Insights-into-DVD-rental-database-through-SQL
## Overview
The project "Insights into DVD Rental Database through SQL" aims to leverage SQL queries to extract valuable insights and perform data analysis on a DVD rental database. By querying the database using SQL, the project seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics related to DVD rentals, customer behavior, movie popularity, and other relevant aspects.
## Objective & Goals
In this project, I’ll aim to answer the following questions:
- What are the top and least rented (in-demand) genres and what are their total sales?
- Can we know how many distinct users have rented each genre?
- What is the average rental rate for each genre? (from the highest to the lowest)
- How many rented films were returned late, early, and on time?
- In which countries does Rent A Film have a presence and what is the customer base in each country? What are the total sales in each country? (from most to least)
- Who are the top 5 customers per total sales and can we get their details just in case Rent A Film wants to reward them?
